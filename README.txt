OpenSDP Data Janitor Tutorial (Stata)
Data Exploration

The purpose of this tutorial is to provide a Stata introduction for education
data analysts who are not yet comfortable using Stata, and to demonstrate useful
data exploration commands. You don't need to know any Stata to do this
tutorial. In Part 1, you will see how to use data exploration commands to
inspect a student-level dataset. In Part 2, you'll get practice 
using data exploration commands to answer simple research questions.

You will need to have Stata version 12 or higher installed on your computer to
run this tutorial. Download, unzip, and extract the files. Open the .smcl file,
and arrange the viewer and main Stata windows side by side so that you can
see them both. Work through the tutorial by clicking on commands in the viewer
window or typing them into the Stata command window.
